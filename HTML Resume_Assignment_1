<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My work background is mainly structured around content creation. I worked at the Orange Umbrella Consultancy where I had to dive into several forms of media where my design is needed. It gave me an advantage to discover and learn what's fresh and new in terms of what consumers want out of communication services. When apart of an agency, employees are constantly put in the position to collaborate with others. Because of this, I am more than comfortable with helping others as it is apart of my work; if the team succeeds then the dream succeeds.  Besides working in an agency setting,  I also pride myself in working directly for the University of Miami as a graphic design assistant for Admissions Marketing; which allowed me to learn the look and feel of the University's design flow upclose.  </p>
